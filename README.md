## Brief introdutction

Here I want to present you my personal output-stream manipulator, called *osmanip*. Probably there are already some similar libraries/manipulators/classes in the web that do the same work, but since I personally don't like them at all I preferred writing my own manipulator, in order to deal with different color and styles in the output stream of any program that I usually write. Using different features for the output stream may be very useful to better read error messages or special informations you want to be sure an user see when he runs the code, or to do many other useful procedures to adorn your general output stream.

## Description of the repository

Excluding this README.md file and the [**License**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/License), the repository contains two directories:
- [**osmanip**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/tree/main/osmanip): which contains two subdirectories:
  * [**include**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/tree/main/osmanip/include): which contains the manipulator declaration file [*osmanip.h*](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/osmanip/include/osmanip.h).
  * [**src**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/tree/main/osmanip/src): which contains the manipulator definition file [*osmanip.cpp*](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/osmanip/src/osmanip.cpp).
- [**main**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/tree/main/main): which contains the

Note: the structure of the repository may seems more complex than what is needed, since there are many subdirectories and a makefile that can be avoided in this case, due to the simplicity of the code with respect to many other complex codes with more than one header file created, however, I usually prefer using this structure since it is the basic structure I use for any C++ code/project, therefore is is just a matter of conventions.
