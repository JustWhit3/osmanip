## Brief introdutction

Here I want to present you my personal output-stream manipulator that I called *ostream*. Probably there are already some similar libraries/manipulators/classes in the web, but since I personally don't like them at all I preferred writing my own manipulator, in order to deal with different color and different styles in the output stream of any program that I usually write.
