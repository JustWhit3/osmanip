## Brief introdutction

Here I want to present you my personal output-stream manipulator, called *ostream*. Probably there are already some similar libraries/manipulators/classes in the web that do the same work, but since I personally don't like them at all I preferred writing my own manipulator, in order to deal with different color and styles in the output stream of any program that I usually write. Using different features for the output stream may be very useful to better read error messages or special informations you want to be sure an user see when he runs the code, or to do many other useful procedures to adorn your general output stream.
