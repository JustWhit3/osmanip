## Introduction

Thank you very much for being here, first of all, I want to let you know that contributions are more than welcome and really appreciated.

In case you want to contribute, even with a small bug fix, you will be featured into the [credits](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/CREDITS.md) file.

[Here](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/doc/Todo.md) you can find a list of todo features / updates that are planned.

## How to contribute

To contribute, please follow these guidelines:

1) Fork your own copy of the repository.
2) Work on your changes / improvements.
3) **Test** if your changes / improvements are correctly implemented and all the other features are not compromised. For this latter requirement, please run the main and tests executables and check if you find something different from before.
4) Optional, but really appreciated: update the [documentation](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/doc) or the main [README](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/README.md) with the new features you added.
5) Finally, make a pull request.

Once your pull request will be submitted, I will carefully review it and, if it will be considered as an improvement, I will confirm it.

## How to raise an issue

If you find any bug or something you think doesn't work correctly in the code, you are free to open an issue, but before carefully read this passages:

1) If this issue is due to download, compilation or installation of the library, be sure to have read [this](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/doc/Download%20and%20install.md) document, in which all the passages are explained carefully.
2) If this issue is due to a code feature, be sure to have run the main and the tests executables before, in order to see if your machine has all the necessary [prerequisites](https://github.com/JustWhit3/osmanip/blob/main/doc/Download%20and%20install.md#:~:text=cd%20osmanip-,Prerequisites,-Mandatory) installed.
