# List of future implementations

- Repository installer script.
- Color palette.
- Implement ANSII escape sequences manipulation.
- Implement other progress bar styles (es: loading bar).
- Use template class and methods for the ProgressBar features, in order to better deal with also double and float variables (already supported, but not optimally working).
- Possibility to use multiple loading bars simultaneously using threads.
